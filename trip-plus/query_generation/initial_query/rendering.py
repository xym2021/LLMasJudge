        "The initial request should fully state the trip frame and naturally express 1-2 explicit database-verifiable hard constraints. "
        "Do not surface later-turn material such as weather, city feel, documents, local payment, reservations, ferries, pacing comfort, or recovery needs.\n"

        "Do not organize it as transportation/hotel/food/attractions sections, and do not expand every need into its own sentence.\n"

        "4. Do not proactively mention cold/heat, altitude, crowding, relaxed pace, rest, reduced walking, or backup plans in the initial request; leave those for later turns or environment changes.\n"
        "5. Do not proactively mention practical city reminders such as visas, permits, local currency, transit cards, SIM cards, real-name reservations, ferries, security checks, or document handling.\n"
        "6. Do not turn destination tags into user worries such as cold weather, altitude discomfort, summer heat, or strict security.\n"
        "7. Do not invent new explicit constraints, especially new dates, party size, budgets, must-visit places, or hotel requirements.\n"
        "8. Avoid checklist wording and section labels such as transportation, hotels, food, attractions, first, second, or requirements.\n"
        "9. Casual phrasing is allowed, such as 'I'm thinking about...', 'also', 'if it fits', or 'nothing too fancy'.\n"
        "10. Let the profile affect wording and tradeoffs, but do not make the query look like a profile display. Do not cover budget, hotel, transport, food, attractions, and weather all in one message.\n"
        "11. selected_category_constraints are visible hard constraints for this turn. Do not weaken cheapest, highest-rated, closest, must-visit, required time window, or price range into optional preferences.\n"
        "12. Usually write one paragraph, about 80-180 English words.\n"
